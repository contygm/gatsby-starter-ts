[Check out DeLorean ipsum!](https://satoristudio.net/delorean-ipsum/). Marty. Marty. Marty. Quiet, quiet. I'm gonna read your thoughts. Let's see now, you've come from a great distance? On the night I go back in time, you get- Doc. Well yeah, you know we have two of them. Mayor Goldie Wilson, I like the sound of that[[1]](#1).

## Marty. Marty. Marty.

Ronald Reagon, the actor? Then who's vice president, Jerry Lewis? I suppose Jane Wymann is the first lady. What's that thing he's on? He's alright. That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair? Can I go now, Mr. Strickland?

It's already mutated into human form, shoot it. he's an idiot, comes from upbringing, parents were probably idiots too. Lorraine, if you ever have a kid like that, I'll disown you. Please note that Einstein's clock is in complete synchronization with my control watch. Uh, look me up when you get there. Shut your filthy mouth, I'm not that kind of girl[[2]](#2).

## You have this thing hooked

You have this thing hooked up to the car? Doc, look, all we need is a little plutonium. Yeah, well uh, lets keep this brain melting stuff to ourselves, okay? What do you mean you've seen this, it's brand new[[3]](#3). Uh?

-   Wait a minute, Doc.
    -   What are you talking about?
        -   What happens to us in the future?
-   What do we become assholes or something?
    -   No no no no no, Marty,
    -   both you and Jennifer turn out fine.

It's your kids, Marty, something has got to be done about your kids. Well, aren't you going up to the lake tonight, you've been planning it for two weeks. Who are you calling spook, pecker-wood. Thanks[[4]](#4).

### Ah, where're my pants?

> Ah, where're my pants? What do you mean you've seen this, it's brand new. Ah. Well, safe and sound, now, n good old 1955. Can't be. This is nuts. Aw, c'mon.

Right. Oh, you make it sound so easy. I just, I wish I wasn't so scared. Doc, she's beautiful. She's crazy about me. Look at this, look what she wrote me, Doc. That says it all. Doc, you're my only hope. Thank god I still got my hair. What on Earth is that thing I'm wearing? That was so stupid, Grandpa hit him with the car[[5]](#5).

### Now that's a good idea

Ah. Yeah, I'm- mayor. Now that's a good idea. I could run for mayor. Well, now we gotta sneak this back into my laboratory, we've gotta get you home. Calvin. Listen, this is very important, I forgot my video camera, could you stop by my place and pick it up on your way to the mall?

1. Keys? This is for all you lovers out there.
1. Yeah well look, Marvin, Marvin, you gotta play.
1. See that's where they kiss for the first time on
1. the dance floor. And if there's no music,
1. they can't dance, and if they can't dance,
1. they can't kiss, and if they can't kiss,

They can't fall in love and I'm history. That's him. Well, she's not doing a very good job.

### He laid out Biff in one punch

He laid out Biff in one punch. I never knew he had it in him. He never stood up to Biff in his life. He's absolutely right, Marty. the last thing you need is headaches. He's alright. Now Biff, don't con me. Good. Have a good trip Einstein, watch your head.

I have to tell you about the future. Doc, Doc. Oh, no. You're alive. Bullet proof vest, how did you know, I never got a chance to tell you. About all that talk about screwing up future events, the space time continuum. Are you okay? Lorenzo, where're you keys? The hell you doing to my car?

## When I was your age

I think it's terrible. Girls chasing boys. When I was your age I never chased a boy, or called a boy, or sat in a parked car with a boy. Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.

<details>
	<summary>Now, Biff, um, can I assume...</summary>

Now, Biff, um, can I assume that your insurance is gonna pay for the damage? Oh, uh, hey you, get your damn hands off her. Do you really think I oughta swear? Uh Doc, uh no. No, don't be silly.

</details>

## Plutonium, wait a minute

What? Huh? Uh, plutonium, wait a minute, are you telling me that this sucker's nuclear? What's going on? Where have you been all week?

Indeed I will, roll em. I, Doctor Emmett Brown, am about to embark on an historic journey. What have I been thinking of, I almost forgot to bring some extra plutonium.

How did I ever expect to get back, one pallet one trip I must be out of my mind. What is it Einy? Oh my god, they found me, I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty.

## Whoa, wait a minute

Uh, coast guard. Whoa, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that my mother has got the hots for me? Lorraine, have you ever, uh, been in a situation where you know you had to act a certain way but when you got there, you didn't know if you could go through with it?

Listen, this is very important, I forgot my video camera, could you stop by my place and pick it up on your way to the mall? Not a word, not a word, not a word now. Quiet, uh, donations, you want me to make a donation to the coast guard youth auxiliary?

## Mr. McFly, Mr. McFly

Mr. McFly, Mr. McFly, this just arrived, oh hi Marty. I think it's your new book. Right, George. Well, good luck you guys. Oh, one other thing, if you guys ever have kids and one of them when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug, be easy on him.

Doc, she didn't even look at him. Stand tall, boy, have some respect for yourself. Don't you know that if you let people walk all over you know, they'll be walking all over you for the rest of your life? Listen to me, do you think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house? Wait a minute, what are you doing, Doc?

## How did you know I was here?

Uh, Lorraine. How did you know I was here? whoa, this is it, this is the part coming up, Doc. Save the clock tower. Marty, will we ever see you again? Good morning.

Alright, c'mon, I think we're safe. Hey George, heard you laid out Biff, nice going. Jesus. You know, Doc, you left your equipment on all week. Crazy drunk drivers.

Yeah, gimme a Tab. I guarantee it. Ronald Reagon, the actor? Then who's vice president, Jerry Lewis? I suppose Jane Wymann is the first lady. The storm. It's a board with wheels.

## Save the clock tower

Save the clock tower. Alright, take it up, go. Doc. Hey guys, you gotta get back in there and finish the dance. Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to get them re-typed.

Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting. I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen would you? Would you? I do understand. If I know too much about my own future I could endanger my own existence, just as you endangered yours.

Now, Biff, um, can I assume that your insurance is gonna pay for the damage? Uh? That's right, twenty five years into the future. I've always dreamed on seeing the future, looking beyond my years, seeing the progress of mankind.

## Ha ha ha very funny

I'll also be able to see who wins the next twenty-five world series. Okay, okay you guys, oh ha ha ha very funny. Hey you guys are being real mature. So what's it to you, butthead. You know you've been looking for a, since you're new here, I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So why don't you make like a tree, and get out of here.
